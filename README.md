This project was put together for my IBM Data Science certification.

The motivation to choose this topic was my passion for travel. I've spent my entire life passionate about aviation and, subsequently, travel. This was perfect given that I began my career in aviation, working for Southwest and American Airlines, and had the privilege to travel very affordably.

Throughout these travels, I found the most anxiety-inducing thing to be picking my neighborhood. Given that my trips typically had a duration of only 2-4 days, the neighborhood I would stay in would be a great asset or liability when venturing through my travel destination.

This is what motivated me to use the skills I've been practicing during this course to build something that would have helped me at the time to at least know a bit more about what I was getting .
